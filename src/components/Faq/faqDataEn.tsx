      'The larger and more popular a commercial VPN service is, the more likely it is to come under the scrutiny of regulatory authorities, and therefore the higher the probability of blocking access to its servers and protocols. With Amnezia you create your own VPN for your use only on the basis of any VPS. When you use your own VPS in conjunction with encrypted VPN protocols, the probability of blocking is significantly reduced. Our users from countries with high blocking rates can attest to this.',

      <>
        <p>
          <strong>Full Control</strong> - you have full control over your own VPN server, including
          configuration, security, logging and data access. You can choose the configuration,
          encryption protocols and security settings according to your requirements. For more
          details, see how amnesia works.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mobility</strong> - ability to use your configured VPN not only with Amnezia
          client, but also with other native OpenVPN, OpenVPN connect or Wireguard applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resistant to IP blocking</strong> - many websites and government regulators know
          the IP addresses of popular VPN servers and blacklist them. Buying a separate VPS, your IP
          address is used only by you and the people with whom you shared your connection data, so
          only you know that this address is used for the VPN
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resistance to VPN protocol blocking</strong> - Amnezia supports the Open VPN
          protocol with cloak, which can be installed when you first connect to the server. More
          details about the cloak plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ability to share with other users</strong> - Amnezia supports the ability to share
          your connection with an unlimited number of users. Just buy any VPS server, connect to it
          with Amnezia, create a configuration for connection and share it with everyone you trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Open Source</strong> - Amnezia, unlike most other VPNs, is open source, both
          server and client side. Amnezia does not collect, store or share user data. Any user can
          verify this by looking at the code on github.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Multiple protocol support</strong> - on a single VPN client you can use a variety
          of protocols from the most secure and safe, such as AmneziaWG and OpenVPN with Cloak
          plugin, to the simplest and fastest, such as Wireguard and IKv2. Learn more about the
          protocols and how to install them.

        <p>
          <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If your country has a very high level of control and blocked
          access to many sites, do not work any commercial and free VPN and VPN protocols, we
          recommend using OpenVPN over Cloak from the first connection. If you use unmasked
          protocols, the ip of your VPS can be blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unmasked protocols OpenVPN over UDP, WireGuard and IKEv2 over UDP are easily detected by
          firewalls and some websites. Sites may show a warning: "disable VPN before visiting site".
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this issue, use OpenVPN with the TCP protocol, OpenVPN over ShadowSocks, or
          OpenVPN over Cloak.
        </p>
        <p>In all other cases, the difference between the protocols is minimal.</p>
