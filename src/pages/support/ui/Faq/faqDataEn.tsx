By using your own VPS in conjunction with encrypted VPN protocols, the chance of blocking is significantly reduced. This is confirmed by our users in countries with high levels of censorship.',

      <>
        <p>
          <strong>Full Control</strong> - you have full control over your own VPN server, including
          configuration, security, logging, and data access. You have the ability to choose the
          configuration, encryption protocols and security settings according to your requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High performance</strong> - self-hosted VPN can offer better speed and performance
          because you control the server resources and can customize it to your needs. This is
          especially useful if you have a large number of users or require high bandwidth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bypass restrictions</strong> - many sites know the IP addresses of popular VPN
          servers and blacklist them. When you buy a separate VPS, your IP address is known only to
          you and the people you have shared your connection data with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mobility</strong> - the ability to use your configured VPN not only with the
          Amnezia client but also with other self-hosted applications that support selected VPN
          protocols.

        <p>
          <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> If your country has a very high level of control, blocked
          access to many sites, do not use any commercial and free VPN and VPN protocols, we
          recommend using OpenVPN over Cloak from the first connection. If you use unmasked
          protocols, the ip of your VPS can be blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>OpenVPN</strong>, over UDP, WireGuard and IKEv2 unmasked protocols over UDP are
          easily detected by firewalls and some sites. Sites may show a warning: "disable VPN before
          visiting site".
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this, use OpenVPN with TCP protocol, OpenVPN over ShadowSocks and OpenVPN over
          Cloak.
        </p>
        <p>In all other cases, the difference between the protocols is minimal.</p>
