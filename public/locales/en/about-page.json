  "p1": "The idea for AmneziaVPN appeared in 2020 during the first Demhack hackathon, and then it was further developed with ",
  "p2": "We wanted users with any technical skills level to be able to create their own VPN, as for simple blocking circumvention and also to ensure privacy and protection of their data. It was important for us to create a free, open-source application so that no user data was collected and there was not even the hypothetical possibility of data leakage.",
  "principles": {
    "header": "We adhere to five principles throughout the development of the project:",
    "principle1": {
      "header": "1. Maximum transparency",
      "text": "Therefore, our application and website are open source, both for the client side and for the server side. We do not collect or store any data, including logs and analytics."
    },
    "principle2": {
      "header": "2. Maximum security",
      "text": "To do this, the best thing you can do is create and use your own personal VPN."
    },
    "principle3": {
      "header": "3. Maximum usability",
      "text": "We have created a simple application with automatic installation so that you do not have to figure out complex settings. Also we placed instructions for buying a VPS from some popular hostings at our website."
    },
    "principle4": {
      "header": "4. Maximum viability",
      "text": "Our solution supports all modern popular protocols, as well as traffic masking to bypass the most severe blocking. This is especially true for countries with the highest level of censorship, where all VPN protocols and almost all commercial and non-commercial VPNs are blocked."
    },
    "principle5": {
      "header": "5. Maximum Flexibility",
      "text": "Maximum Flexibility Amnezia does not require to use the client. You can run VPN from the Amnezia app, create a configured connection file and use it with other original clients like OpenVPN, Wireguard and more..."
    }
  },
  "p3": "Our main goal is to make a self-hosted client that is not functionally different from the top commercial VPNs. That's why we already have kill-switch, separate tunneling of sites and applications. We also make possible to create a corporate VPN network and share unlimited VPN connections with other users.",
  "p4": "Amnezia is not only a VPN. Using the client, you can create your own DNS server, secure file storage and deploy a WordPress site on the Tor network in two clicks. We make the best secureand reliable free self-hosted VPN in the world and we want everyone who needs a free internet to know about it.",
